# CPSO with Spatially Meaningful Neighbors  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Peter-Wilson/CPSO.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Peter-Wilson/CPSO)
Cooperative PSO with Spatially Meaningful Neighbors using Delaunay Triangulation to create a minimum weight triangulation, connecting particles with their closest neighbors.
